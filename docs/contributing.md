# Contributing to brain development

brain is developed in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) 
with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com).
The backend will be (eventually) developed in Typescript with 
[Express](https://expressjs.com) on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).
If any of this is to your liking, feel free to fork the repository
and open pull requests with features or bugfixes.
